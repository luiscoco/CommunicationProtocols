## HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)

HTTP is a protocol for fetching resources such as HTML documents. 

It is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web and it is a client-server protocol.

## HTTP/3

HTTP/3 is the next major revision of the HTTP. 

It runs on QUIC, a new transport protocol designed for mobile-heavy internet usage. 

It relies on UDP instead of TCP, which enables faster web page responsiveness. 

VR applications demand more bandwidth to render intricate details of a virtual scene and will likely benefit from migrating to HTTP/3 powered by QUIC.

## HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure)

HTTPS extends HTTP and uses encryption for secure communications.

## WebSocket

WebSocket is a protocol that provides full-duplex communications over TCP. 

Clients establish WebSockets to receive real-time updates from the back-end services. Unlike REST, which always “pulls” data, WebSocket enables data to be “pushed”.

Applications, like online gaming, stock trading, and messaging apps leverage WebSocket for real-time communication.

## TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

TCP is is designed to send packets across the internet and ensure the successful delivery of data and messages over networks. 

Many application-layer protocols build on top of TCP.

## UDP (User Datagram Protocol)

UDP sends packets directly to a target computer, without establishing a connection first. 

UDP is commonly used in time-sensitive communications where occasionally dropping packets is better than waiting.

Voice and video traffic are often sent using this protocol.

## SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)

SMTP is a standard protocol to transfer electronic mail from one user to another.

## FTP (File Transfer Protocol)

FTP is used to transfer computer files between client and server. It has separate connections for the control channel and data channel.
